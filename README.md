# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure: Uncommon Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the `expo prebuild` command in Expo CLI. The error is characterized by a vague or missing error message, making debugging challenging.  This example focuses on identifying potential causes and providing solutions.

## Problem
The `expo prebuild` command fails without providing sufficient information to pinpoint the issue. This can be frustrating when dealing with complex projects or custom native modules.

## Solution
The solution often involves systematically checking various aspects of your project configuration:

1. **Verify Package.json:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with your Expo SDK version.
2. **Check EAS Build configuration:** If using EAS Build, confirm your build configuration is correct, particularly for native modules.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project cache and rebuilding.
4. **Check Native Module Integration:** Carefully review any custom native modules for potential errors or incompatibilities.
5. **Check Expo Version:** Make sure you are using the latest version of Expo CLI.
6. **Examine System Logs:** Explore system logs for more detailed error messages that might not appear directly in the console.
