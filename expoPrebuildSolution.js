The solution requires a systematic debugging approach. Here's a breakdown of steps to take:

1. **Reproduce the error:** Ensure the error is consistently reproducible. This helps isolate the problematic area.
2. **Examine Logs:** Check for more detailed error messages in the system logs (usually found in the Xcode console for iOS or Android Studio's Logcat for Android). These logs may provide clues about the root cause.
3. **Simplify the Project:** Create a minimal reproduction of your project to help pinpoint the problematic code or dependency.  Gradually add components back in to identify the exact culprit.
4. **Update Dependencies:** Update all project dependencies (including Expo) to their latest versions. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer releases.
5. **Review Native Module Integration:** If using native modules, review their integration carefully. Ensure they are correctly configured and linked with your project.
6. **Check Expo Config:** Review the `expo.json` or `app.json` file to ensure the configurations are correct and compatible with the build process.
7. **EAS Build Options:** If using EAS Build, check your build options for any potential conflicts.
8. **Consult Community/Documentation:** Search the Expo community forums or consult Expo's documentation for any similar issues or solutions.
